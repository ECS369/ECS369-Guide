 EASTSIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE PORTAL
 Main Portal
The Main Portal serves as the central hub for accessing different functionalities within the system. It provides a secure login using an authentication token from the Monster UI portal. Once logged in, users will have access to the following menus: 
1.   	Ticketing System
The Ticketing System menu allows users to manage and track customer tickets.
 Users are automatically logged in using the same authentication token as the Main Portal, ensuring a seamless experience.
 If a ticket needs to be raised during a call, the user can switch to the Ticketing System menu while the call is still ongoing and create a ticket for further resolution.
 Each ticket created will be associated with the customer and their specific concern, facilitating efficient ticket management and resolution.
2.   	DT App Call Center
 The DT App Call Center menu provides functionality for making and receiving calls.
 Agents can handle customer inquiries and complaints during calls, ensuring effective communication and issue resolution.
 If a call requires the agent to raise a ticket, they can navigate to the Ticketing System menu while the call is in progress and create a ticket without interrupting the call.
 This seamless integration between the DT App Call Center and the Ticketing System enhances productivity and customer support.
3.   	Contact List
 The Contact List feature retrieves external contacts from the address book of the DT App.
 Users can access and search for customer contacts within the Main Portal.
 If an agent receives a call and the customer raises a complaint during the call, the agent can navigate to the Ticketing System menu and create a ticket specific to that customer's name in the contact list.
In case the customer does not exist in the contact list, the Main Portal provides an alternative approach.
The DT App's Recent menu will include an icon next to the customer's number. Clicking on this icon will open a form where the agent can add the customer's name and other relevant details to create a new contact.
This ensures that all customer interactions are properly recorded and ticket creation is streamlined, even for new contacts.
Please refer to the attached flow chart for a visual representation of the Main Portal's functionalities and interactions.
